# RandomPokemonGenerator
Will generate a random pokemon on request!


FOR FUTURE
- Be able to create a team of 6 randomly generated pokemon
- Able to generate stats and items as well
- improvement in the design of the site
- create a mini game where two people can generate 6 pokemon and be able to use them as cards which functions like a mini rock paper scissors...
    -> works as person 1 and 2 choose 1 out of their 6 randomly generated pokemon which will battle with each other resulting in a win, loss or tie.

    there will be a total of 6 rounds and the winner of the round will be determined by who has a winning type advantage...

    for example
    water pokemon beats fire because water to fire is 2x weakness where as fire to water is 0.5x weakness.

    a tie case scenario would be two dragon types as they are both 2x weakness to each other

    the winner of the game is decided by who wins most of the 6 matchups and if tied can rematch until a winner is decided.

    can try to encorporate shiny pokemon to have a joker claus which auto wins unless matched against another shiny which will make the round matchup negate the shiny claus and treat both pokemon as normal sprites.
